You (from this point on referred to as The You) are hereby granted by
me (from this point on referred to as The Me) to knock yourself
silly with this piece of software (from this point on referred as "IT").
By using IT The You implicitly accepts this license and pledges solemnly
to never claim creative ownership of any graphics, code, concepts, eggs,
bacon, ideas, colors, shapes, hypertext-transfer protocols or other
conduits of the intellectual splendor thatis IT.

The Me, in turn, pledges equally solemnly to be far too lazy to ever check
up on you, so if you do manage to pull some chicks The Me won't have a cow.
However The Me would be sorely disappointed if The You were to try and sell
or distribute this work without acknowledging The Me. Seriously. The Me
will come down on The You like a large quantitiy of hard and heavy objects
that in large quantities may be harmful and possibly even lethal to The You;
So don't even think about it.
