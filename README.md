# What the heck?

This is a slightly modified version of the original `dcu.bst` style, which features the following changes (last updated: 2012-08-29, if there are any newer commits, I might have forgotten to update this list):

* URL access date is displayed right after the URL (from the "urldate" field), with the following format:
    * URL: <url> (last accessed: <urldate>)

# Installation

On Mac OS X, you can clone this repository into the

    ~/Library/texmf/bibtex/bst/

directory (which you might need to create). You should then by able to use the style like any built-in one.
